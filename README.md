# kellyfamilywebsite

Purpose / Business Case
The intent of this website is to provide the Kelly family (and their extended families) with a single source of information about the various family units and individual family members. 

There will be no personal identifiable information on the website.

The idea is to share information, photoâ€™s, events across the group and use as a planning tool for events that are of interest to all or sub groups of the family.

The initial release will provide a way for family members to access the family cookbook which was created by Vincent and Ouida Kelly of which there is only one hard copy in existence. The cost to duplicate and distribute the cook book is prohibitive and the family would like to see new recipes added to the book as the kids and grandkids mature. 

Use case 1
As a family member I would like to be able to access and view the cookbook on-line anytime I need to find my specific favorite dishes without having to contact the current caretaker of the book.

Use case 2
As a family member (chef) I wouold like to be able to print the menu in a user friendly format without graphics or color 

Use Case 3
As a family member I would like to be able to submit new recipes to be included in the cookbook via the website. in various formats e.g. as text or as a scanned image. 

Use Case 4
As a family member I would like submit the recipes in various formats e.g. as text or as a scanned image. ????
